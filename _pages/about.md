Hello, I am a Technology Consultant at [PwC India](https://www.pwc.in/). I am interested in pursuing research in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, especially where it can be applied to social sciences and public policy research.

I am also a Data Scientist volunteer for [DSSG Solve](https://solveforgood.org/), where we are collaborating with the [International Water Management Institute](https://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/) to research and analyze social media discourse around extreme weather events in developing countries.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Information Technology at the [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), in 2019, where I worked with [Prof. Saptarshi Ghosh](https://sites.google.com/site/saptarshighosh/) in the field of text summarization.
