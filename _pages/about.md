Hello, I am a graduate student in the [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I am supervised by [Professor Kate Larson](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~klarson/index.html). My research is focused on building fair and transparent AI/ML solutions, specifically in fair ranking, search, and voting systems, with a background in machine learning and NLP.

Previously, I was a Technology Consultant at [PwC India](https://www.pwc.in/). I was also a Data Scientist for [DSSG Solve](https://solveforgood.org/), where we collaborated with the [International Water Management Institute](https://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/) to research and analyze social media discourse around extreme weather events.

I completed my undergraduate studies in Information Technology at the [Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur, India](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), in 2019, where I worked with [Professor Saptarshi Ghosh](https://sites.google.com/site/saptarshighosh/) in the field of text summarization.
