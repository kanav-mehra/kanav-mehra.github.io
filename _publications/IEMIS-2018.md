Summarization of microblogs posted during emergency situations is an important and practical problem. While a large number of summarization algorithms have been proposed in the literature, to our knowledge, there has not been any systematic comparison of how effective different algorithms are in summarizing microblogs related to disaster events. In this work, we perform such a comparison of eight extractive summarization algorithms, over microblogs posted during five disaster events. We observe that the algorithms generate vastly diverse summaries, and while some algorithms (e.g. LUHN, COWTS) achieve relatively high ROUGE scores, some other algorithms such as LexRank do not appear so effective.
