excerpt: 'In this work, we investigate whether off-the-shelf summarization algorithms can be combined to produce better quality summaries. We propose two ensemble schemes -- an unsupervised scheme and a supervised scheme -- that can combine the outputs of multiple base summarization algorithms, to produce summaries that are better than what is obtained from any of the individual base algorithms.'

We propose two ensemble schemes that combine the outputs of multiple extractive summarization algorithms to create better quality, multi-faceted summaries. First, an unsupervised graph-based scheme, that groups the tweets according to different similarity measures and selects a representative tweet from each group while minimizing redundancy. Second, a supervised approach, that uses Learning-to-Rank algorithms to learn a mechanism to rank tweets in order of importance, based on the rankings computed by different base algorithms.
