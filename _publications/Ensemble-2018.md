<b>Abstract:</b>
We investigate whether off-the-shelf summarization algorithms can be combined to produce better quality summaries. To this end, we propose ensemble schemes that can combine the outputs of multiple base summarization algorithms, to produce summaries better than what is generated by any of the base algorithms.
