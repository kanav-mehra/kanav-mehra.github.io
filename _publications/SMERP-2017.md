The [SMERP Data Challenge](https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~dganguly/smerp2017/), organised by the 39th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2017), was about extracting and summarizing information relevant to a set of practical information needs (topics) that are critical for post-disaster relief operations, such as need and availability of resources, infrastructure damage and restoration, etc. The track used a [dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3336563#.X5cDE4gzZPZ) of microblogs posted during the August 2016 earthquake in central Italy.

In this paper, we present a semi-automatic method that exploits a combination of SumBasic Summarizer and different classifiers to summarize the topic wise relevant microblogs (tweets) extracted through manually identified query-term matching. Acordingly, our method obtained the overall first place in the SMERP 2017 Data Challenge - Summarization Track, highlighting that it is an effective approach in summarizing tweets in a disaster scenario and can be replicated across diverse domains.
