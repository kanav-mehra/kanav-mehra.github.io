title: 'Amphan - Analyzing Experiences of Extreme Weather Events using Online Data'
collection: projects
excerpt: 'The DSSG Solve team, in collaboration with the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), aims to develop research methodologies that leverage online social media data to better understand the experiences and needs of vulnerable communities affected by natural disasters. This research tool would enable users to tap into the online discourse and social, political, and economic effects of extreme weather events. Through our goal, we hope to derive actionable insights to supplement on-the-ground efforts and help inform critical policy-making processes.'
